# Starfx Playground: A Light Introduction

Welcome to a breezy and informal exploration of Starfx, a distinctive side-effect management system complemented by a store! For a foundational understanding of Starfx, delve into Eric Bower's explanation on his [blog](https://bower.sh/what-is-starfx). This playful space is carved to offer a glimpse and hands-on experience on:

- **Setting up Starfx**
- **Managing side-effects, APIs, and Thunks the Starfx way**
- **Crafting channels**
- **Creating a raw but effective Store viewer**
- **Developing a persistent slice** _(This is just a stopgap until an official solution is available.)_

## About This Project

This app is your go-to place for dabbling with and unraveling the functionalities of Starfx in a fun way. It’s not a comprehensive guide; it’s more of a playful corner to explore and perhaps, grasp a thing or two about how Starfx works.
You can check this app on codesandbox [here](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/VldMrgnn/starfx-store).

## Overview

- **Starfx Setup**: A friendly introduction to initializing Starfx.
- **Channel Exploration**: A beginner's guide to implementing channels in Starfx.
- **Store Viewer Interaction**: Practical tips on establishing and interacting with a Store viewer.
- **Persistent Slice Experimentation**: A provisional approach to experimenting with persistent slices until a formal method is introduced.

## Source of Truth

For a more detailed and structured understanding, please refer to the [official Starfx repository](https://github.com/neurosnap/starfx) and [official examples](https://github.com/neurosnap/starfx-examples).
