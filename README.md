# This is a proof of concept for an implementation of the Starfx Store

The aim is to provide an example of

- The use and setup of a Starfx Store
- Robodux like createAssign
- Robodux like createTable
- Implementation of a channel
- Implementation of a Store viewer
- Implementation of a persitent slice

The techniques used are a starting point for a more complete implementation or further experimentation.
